\cvsection{Profile}

High efficient and self-motivated Full Stack Software Engineer who enjoys
finding elegant solutions to non-trivial problems. Focused on the goal and
driven by visual sophistication and laser-sharp precision, I take pride in
every finished project, and never stop learning along the way.

Specialties: Solving IT problems and getting things done, quickly and efficiently.
I can view the larger picture, analyze the situation, and devise and implement a
strategy to achieve the desired outcome.

I am proficient in C/C++, Python, PHP, SQL, Linux, Docker, Nginx. My first commercial
project was in 1999 using Delphi. I'm interested in developing big projects using
Python now.
